# Develop an integrated app that utilizes partial transcript notifications (DRAFT)

![Partial transcript app flowchart](blueprint/images/flowchart.png "Partial transcript app flowchart")

## Description

This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint demonstrates how partial transcript notifications can be used in the context of a Genesys Cloud Integration.  The sample app is based around an admin dashboard that allows an administrator to view the active conversations for the queues in their organization. For each conversation, the admin can view its ongoing transcript, the agent assigned to the call, and the "standing" of the call, which is a binary good-or-bad state depending on whether one of the red-listed words is uttered by the agent.  The blueprint describes the steps needed to develop this app and integrate it into  Genesys Cloud.

See the blueprint documentation for more details.
